# Graph Database

This is a database of all graphs with 8 or fewer vertices, plus some extra graphs. For each graph, we record a number of pieces of data, so you can filter for all graphs having certain characteristics.

We used to run this as a webpage service. To put this up again, the code would need to be revamped to not have security issues, and probably also to bring it up to modern Javascript and web standards.
